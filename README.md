# OOP-Lab-0
At this Laboratory work I had to change my OS from windows to linux(Fedora) ,which was kinda painful but understandable. 
**I chose the dual-boot path**
So first of all I installed Fedora and Rufus usb, 
I allocated some space for it so it had where to get installed.
I restarted the PC, chose the OS I wanted to go with and started configuring it by installing the essential tools aka "starting pack" which can be seen in the screenshots I took.
